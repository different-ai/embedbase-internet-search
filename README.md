The point of internet search in embedbase is to combine your private information with latest public information.

Also remember that AIs like ChatGPT have limited knowledge to a certain date, for example try to ask ChatGPT about GPT4 or about Sam Altman talk with the senate (which happened few days ago), it will not know about it.


Please check [examples](./examples/answer-question/README.md) for usage.
